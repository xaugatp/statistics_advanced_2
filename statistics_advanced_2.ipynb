    "It provides insights into the behavior of the sampling distribution of the mean, helping statisticians make probabilistic statements about the accuracy of sample means in estimating population parameters.\n",
    "Population Distribution Irrelevance:\n",

    "Regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the distribution of the sample mean becomes normal for large sample sizes. This allows researchers to make generalizations about populations, even when the population distribution is unknown or not normal.\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a powerful statistical concept, but it comes with certain assumptions. For the CLT to hold and for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be approximately normal, the following assumptions need to be satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence:**\n",
    "   - The sampled observations must be independent. This means that the selection of one observation should not influence the selection of another. Independence is crucial for the validity of the CLT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Sampling:**\n",
    "   - The data must be collected through a process of random sampling. Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. This ensures that the sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - The sample size (\\(n\\)) should be \"sufficiently large.\" While there is no strict rule for what constitutes a large sample size, a common guideline is \\(n \\geq 30\\). Larger sample sizes tend to yield better approximations to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Population Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The CLT does not specify the shape of the population distribution. However, for very skewed distributions, larger sample sizes may be required for the CLT to hold. In practice, if the original distribution is not extremely skewed, the CLT tends to work well even for moderate sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Finite Variance:**\n",
    "   - The population from which the samples are drawn should have a finite variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). If the variance is infinite, the CLT may not hold.\n",
